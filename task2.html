            In a world where the towns are peopled with cars, and even the bugs are mini motors, a young ambitious racing car called Lightning McQueen is a star. 
            On his way to an important event he has to stop in the little town of Radiator Springs after he accidentally damages the road and is forced to repair it.
             He finds living in a community oddly endearing, making true friends and beginning to realise there's more in life than winning.
